# ProjectEulerFSharp

![.NET Core](https://github.com/niklasstich/EulerProblemsFSharp/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

An implementation of the euler problems in F#.
The problems can be found [here](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

Some inspiration and help was drawn from the wonderful solutions proposed by Yan (theburningmonk). His solutions can be found [on his site](https://theburningmonk.com/project-euler-solutions/) or on [Github](https://github.com/theburningmonk/ProjectEuler-FSharp-Solutions).

# Warning: 
The Test folder contains regression tests that test the implementation against the correct answers, which means the correct answers are hardcoded in these files. Don't look at them if you don't want to get spoiled, although I do realize that you could also just copy paste the code from this repository and run it to obtain these values. Anyway, you have been warned.
