# EulerProblemsFSharp
An implementation of the euler problems in F#.
The problems can be found [here](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

Some inspiration and help was drawn from the wonderful solutions proposed by Yan (theburningmonk). His solutions can be found [on his site](https://theburningmonk.com/project-euler-solutions/) or on [Github](https://github.com/theburningmonk/ProjectEuler-FSharp-Solutions).
